    <h1>Tuna Casserole</h1>
    <p>This is another favorite chaildhood recipe of mine. If you love a creamy casserole, and love tuna then this is a recipe for you. The noodles are 
      always so pleasently tender and creamy, the cellery adds a nice little crunch with every bite, and the onions add a nice enjoyable flaver to the dish. 
      This is also a nice quick recipe, only taking about 35 minutes to complete so it is a good dish for the nights you don't have a lot of time to cook.</p>
  
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 12 ounce package of egg noodles</li>
