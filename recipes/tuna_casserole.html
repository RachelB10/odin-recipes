  <p>This is another favorite chaildhood recipe of mine. If you love a creamy casserole,
    and love tuna then this is a recipe for you. The noodles are always so pleasently tender
    and creamy, the cellery adds a nice little crunch with every bite, and the onions add a
    nice enjoyable flaver to the dish. This is also a nice quick recipe, only taking about 35
    minutes to complete so it is a good dish for the nights you don't have a lot of time to cook.</p>
