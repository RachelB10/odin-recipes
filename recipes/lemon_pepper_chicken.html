    <p>This is a recipe that my mom would make when I was growing up and that I've always loved.
      The chicken was always so nice and juicy, the potatos were always so soft and the onions
      would add good flavor to every bite. I would say this is one of my top favorite foods
      growing up.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>4-6 Boneless chicken breasts</li>
      <li>4 Potatos</li>
      <li>1 Onion</li>
      <li>1-2 Sticks of butter</li>
      <li>Lemon pepper seasoning</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Cut the potatoes into cubes then boil them for 15 minutes. You can then take that time to cut
        the onions into slices, then cut the slices in half to create C shaped pieces.</li><br>

      <li>Preheat the oven to 400*F then melt the butter into a sauce pan, or heat in the microwave until melted. Take some of
        the butter and grease 1-2 casserole pans, placing 4 chicken breasts in 1 pan, or 3 each in 2 pans.</li><br>
      
      <li>Add the onions and potatoes in the 1 or 2 pans around the chicken. Pour the rest of the melted butter
        over the chicken, potatoes, and onions then season them with the lemon pepper seasoning.</li><br>
      
      <li>Last, but not least, set the dishes in the oven and let bake for 40 minutes. Check occasionally after 
        the 30 minute mark to see if the chicken is cooked all the way through.</li><br>
      
      <li>Pull the pans out of the oven and let cool before serving.</li>
    </ol>
