# odin-recipes
This is my first project for The Odin Project curriculum and in it, I
will be making a simple Recipes website to show off some of my favorite
recipes. By the end of this project, I will have demonstrated some of
the following skills:

  - Use basic HTML to create a website that will be easy for viewers to
read and navigate

  - Create a neat and easy to read commit history for myself and others
to view
